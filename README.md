   <h2> My Background </h2>
</header>
                <p1> 18-year-old, born on the 30th August 2000 in Carlton Australia, I graduated VCE in 2018. While attending school, I had experience as an intern in companies such as Tata Consultancy Services and ACONEX, both in areas with relation to IT and programming. With my parents being born in Iraq, I have always been open to the tragic news of war, refugees and the after effects war has on many of the children who are left orphaned. Speaking both Arabic and English, I was always surfing the net to read about the stories of the people who fell victim to such events. This led me to have the hobby of helping out in organizations that provide shelter and help to those in need. With around 5 years experience in volunteering in all areas that would bring a smile on childrenâ€™s faces, I decided to complete a degree in Information technology so that I can eventually help people all around the world. An interesting fact about me is that I jump around alot, meaning that where ever you place me, I will find something to do, out of the ordinary. For example, while everyone walks through an opening, I will try and jump the gate!! (While being mindful of others and my surroundings, PROMISE).

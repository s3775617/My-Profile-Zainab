   <h2> My Background </h2>
</header>
                <p1> 18-year-old, born on the 30th August 2000 in Carlton Australia, I graduated VCE in 2018. While attending school, I had experience as an intern in companies such as Tata Consultancy Services and ACONEX, both in areas with relation to IT and programming. With my parents being born in Iraq, I have always been open to the tragic news of war, refugees and the after effects war has on many of the children who are left orphaned. Speaking both Arabic and English, I was always surfing the net to read about the stories of the people who fell victim to such events. This led me to have the hobby of helping out in organizations that provide shelter and help to those in need. With around 5 years experience in volunteering in all areas that would bring a smile on children’s faces, I decided to complete a degree in Information technology so that I can eventually help people all around the world. An interesting fact about me is that I jump around alot, meaning that where ever you place me, I will find something to do, out of the ordinary. For example, while everyone walks through an opening, I will try and jump the gate!! (While being mindful of others and my surroundings, PROMISE).

   <h2>  Interest in IT  </h2>
</header>

<h3> What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?
</h3>
        <p1> My interest surrounding IT began when I left to live with my father in Iraq in 2012 for a couple of years. Having my mother and brother overseas, I became really interested in computers and the systems behind it as I had used it as a source of communication and liking. No one in my family was really into technology however seeing how applications such as Google Maps and websites such as eBay had been able to reach people all over the world, questions started to arise. How did all this become? I never really believed that Google Maps was just, simply and plainly Google Maps. That is where my interest in IT was sparked. I gained experience in IT when I applied for a two-week intern ship at ACONEX, a company providing mobile and web-based collaboration technologies for project information and process management, on a software as a service basis, to clients in all areas. Having two pc monitors, a laptop and a fully supplied desk, made my interest in IT grow more and more. I was assigned to code a tic tac toe game and even though it may be considered a simple code, at that time it felt good to achieve writing it. </p1>

<h3> Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h3>
        <p1> I remember seeing RMIT university advertisements on the television when I was in year 9, the excitement I had was indescribable. Knowing that it is one of the highest qualified universities for IT made it even more the reason of choosing it to be the place in which I complete my degree. It is called the ‘Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology’ for a reason. I had also gone to the RMIT Melbourne city campus for VCE lectures held by ATAR Notes and the vibe this university gave made studying feel fun. Thus, I chose to apply and here I am today. </p1> 

 <h3> What do you expect to learn during your studies? </h3>
        <p1> Studying at RMIT and choosing this specific course, I expect to learn about how technology works, the software and hardware of a pc and programming languages. I really hope to study about different languages such as java, python, c++ and many more. Understanding the basics of these will help me to develop applications, games and websites to assist me in my future career. I expect to learn enough to help me graduate with high scores so that I will know what I am doing when I do something related to IT. </p1>

 <h3> The Position? </h3>
        <p1> The position of being a senior software Engineer appeals to me as the role of designing, developing and installing software appears exciting. Jobs like this won’t make me bored as I like to do different things every day. As being in this position means I need to write and integrate APIs using C# and Web API, I will be open to a lot of challenges that will guide my knowledge into the right path. Web development in this role like to write code, drive improvements, manage pull requests and commits using Git is an aspect I have only just been open to which I find extremely fun to do. If being in this position means that I will be able to experience many aspects of software and engineering, then I am more than happy to set it as my goal.  </p1>

 <h3> The Skills, Qualifications and Experiance Required? </h3>
        <p1> To be accepted into this position, I will need to be able to work in the Philippines and I must be qualified with a bachelor’s degree in Information technology, Computer science, Engineering in computer or telecommunications or equivalent. This degree needs to be backed up with at least 5 years’ experience in both the fields that meet the needs of a Senior Software Engineer position and Supplementary qualifications experience in building API’s from scratch in an environment of complexity with preference to using (SOA) service-oriented architecture. Knowledge and experience in conducting testing and running transcripts, and agile methodology is required. Other requirements include skills in software development, demonstrating logical, creative and analytical thinking and owning written and verbal communication skills in English.  </p1>

 <h3> The Skills, Qualifications and Experiance I Have? </h3>
        <p1> The skills, qualifications and experience I currently have included written and verbal communication skills in both English and Arabic and Basic knowledge of writing code, managing pull requests and commits using Git. I have started a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT and hoping to graduate in the year 2021. Being an SRC (School representative council) member for 2 years in my high school I have gained strong skills in communication, team work, logical, analytical and creative thinking.  </p1>

 <h3> The Plan? </h3>
        <p1> In order to obtain these skills, I will follow a plan in which will allow me to reach my goals. I will approach the plan as follows. Completing my Bachelor of Information Technology to the best of my abilities while watching tutorials and guides in how to develop and code software. I will try my best to read as much as possible about the areas surrounding Engineers in all aspects. I will then try to apply for internship at companies across the range of computers and programming to gain the 5-year experience that would help me achieve qualifications and skills that will allow me to succeed in such positions. While all this will be going on, I hope to play around with code and experiment different areas so that I will have an idea about different languages. Code academy and khan academy will be a good source to gain some basic experience. </p1>

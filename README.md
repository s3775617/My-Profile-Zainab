   <h2> My Background </h2>
</header>
                <p1> 18-year-old, born on the 30th August 2000 in Carlton Australia, I graduated VCE in 2018. While attending school, I had experience as an intern in companies such as Tata Consultancy Services and ACONEX, both in areas with relation to IT and programming. With my parents being born in Iraq, I have always been open to the tragic news of war, refugees and the after effects war has on many of the children who are left orphaned. Speaking both Arabic and English, I was always surfing the net to read about the stories of the people who fell victim to such events. This led me to have the hobby of helping out in organizations that provide shelter and help to those in need. With around 5 years experience in volunteering in all areas that would bring a smile on children’s faces, I decided to complete a degree in Information technology so that I can eventually help people all around the world. An interesting fact about me is that I jump around alot, meaning that where ever you place me, I will find something to do, out of the ordinary. For example, while everyone walks through an opening, I will try and jump the gate!! (While being mindful of others and my surroundings, PROMISE).

   <h2>  Interest in IT  </h2>
</header>

<h3> What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?
</h3>
        <p1> My interest surrounding IT began when I left to live with my father in Iraq in 2012 for a couple of years. Having my mother and brother overseas, I became really interested in computers and the systems behind it as I had used it as a source of communication and liking. No one in my family was really into technology however seeing how applications such as Google Maps and websites such as eBay had been able to reach people all over the world, questions started to arise. How did all this become? I never really believed that Google Maps was just, simply and plainly Google Maps. That is where my interest in IT was sparked. I gained experience in IT when I applied for a two-week intern ship at ACONEX, a company providing mobile and web-based collaboration technologies for project information and process management, on a software as a service basis, to clients in all areas. Having two pc monitors, a laptop and a fully supplied desk, made my interest in IT grow more and more. I was assigned to code a tic tac toe game and even though it may be considered a simple code, at that time it felt good to achieve writing it. </p1>

<h3> Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h3>
        <p1> I remember seeing RMIT university advertisements on the television when I was in year 9, the excitement I had was indescribable. Knowing that it is one of the highest qualified universities for IT made it even more the reason of choosing it to be the place in which I complete my degree. It is called the ‘Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology’ for a reason. I had also gone to the RMIT Melbourne city campus for VCE lectures held by ATAR Notes and the vibe this university gave made studying feel fun. Thus, I chose to apply and here I am today. </p1> 

 <h3> What do you expect to learn during your studies? </h3>
        <p1> Studying at RMIT and choosing this specific course, I expect to learn about how technology works, the software and hardware of a pc and programming languages. I really hope to study about different languages such as java, python, c++ and many more. Understanding the basics of these will help me to develop applications, games and websites to assist me in my future career. I expect to learn enough to help me graduate with high scores so that I will know what I am doing when I do something related to IT. </p1>

 <h3> The Position? </h3>
        <p1> The position of being a senior software Engineer appeals to me as the role of designing, developing and installing software appears exciting. Jobs like this won’t make me bored as I like to do different things every day. As being in this position means I need to write and integrate APIs using C# and Web API, I will be open to a lot of challenges that will guide my knowledge into the right path. Web development in this role like to write code, drive improvements, manage pull requests and commits using Git is an aspect I have only just been open to which I find extremely fun to do. If being in this position means that I will be able to experience many aspects of software and engineering, then I am more than happy to set it as my goal.  </p1>

   <h2> Project Idea </h2>
</header>
        <p1> <br>  
             “_MyCompanion_”, a new application that would change the way visually impaired people go on with their daily lives. Have you ever seen a person with a disability of not being able to see, do you know how it feels to be in their position? This application is a hand stretched out to those in need. Designed with the latest technology and programming languages, hoping to provide an application that would be the eye for blind people. All the individual needs to do is take a video of their house, office, local park etc. and the software would interpret the number of steps and blockage ways associated with that area. Then the app is ready to go. Say ‘My Home’ and your position would be determined then simply ask the app “where is my bed?”.  The app will then reply according to the distance and directions needed. “Please take three steps forward and one step right”.<br> <p1/>
             
<p2> <br>
     Supporting the visually impaired with a tool to assist them other than sympathy and just talk will help ensure that they are not to live in constant fear that one day something will go wrong. Statistics show that according to the ‘World Health Organization’, it is estimated, that approximately 1.3 billion people live with some form of vision impairment globally. 36 million of those are completely blind. Supporting these statistics, many people with vision impairment are over the age of 50 years. This means that not only are they blind, they are also at an age that makes them vulnerable to their surroundings. What makes this project interesting, is that there is no need for outside aid. One can stay within their privacy and they are not required to ask for help from others they may not find themselves comfortable with. An app on hand, a voice to guide and a step by step direction to their destination.  <br>
     <p2/>
 <p3> <br>  ‘MyCompanion’ is a smart application accompanied by artificial intelligence that will boost the features offered. A one to one communication tool to provide support where necessary. The features of this application include step by step directions to destination. To begin, the application will ask the individual what they would like to name their ‘companion’, this feature allows users to feel comfortable when asking a request, “Where am I Sara”.  The application will then undergo a series of configuration steps to allow the application to run smoothly. This includes the calibration of the customers normal stride and how many steps it takes to get to a certain destination. This will include taking a step in all four directions, north, south, east and west. By applying this tool, we can make sure that the safety of the user is met and that no collisions will occur. Second, the voice testing that determines the tone and speech of the customer. This requires the user to say a few words and sentences so that the application would be able to determine the voice of the user and save it to the device. Third, the volume which tests the background noise and the ability for the individual to hear clearly. This requires the user to record the sound of both the indoors of the area and the outdoors depending on where the location is. After completing the configuration testing, the most important aspect begins, which is adding the destination. MyCompanion will ask the user which area he/she would like to add. Example of adding a room is as follows. “What would you like to add Lorain?”, the user will answer “My Home”. By naming what he/she would like to add, the application then undergoes GIS mapping, which is a geographic information system designed to store, retrieve, manage, display, and analyze data. This will be done by videoing the whole house from start to finish to ensure that all routes are recorded. Implemented systems will allow the imagery and videoing of the house or office etc. be turned into a GPS mapping system that would guide the one in need. Completing the settings of the house and adding the rooms, bathrooms etc., the application is ready to go. <br>
      <img src="http://i68.tinypic.com/25692xu.png" alt="" height="auto">
      <p3/> 
<p4> <br> MyCompanion will be accompanied by artificial intelligence that will be the voice of the application. The AI will be programmed to ask and respond to the needs of the user. The mapping of the application will use software such as QGIS which is part of the GIS mapping system. This will take care of the location needed. Calabash would be used to test the application after it is final so that it is made sure that it works on both IOS and android. Languages will also be applied to assist people in all countries.  <br>
<p4/> 
<p5> <br> In order to develop this application, I will need many qualifications in different areas so that the program could run accordingly. The programing language ‘Python’ is a priority and highly required so that the standards are met. Skills in areas such as Web frameworks, Object-relational mappers, understanding multi-process architecture, Developing and using RESTful APIs and building Python applications will assist in having the software developed in a modern and easy to use way.  By having these, a program will need to be written by the rules to meet guidelines. With the experience I currently have and the level of knowledge I possess, developing such software will not be likely as I still need more skills to back me up for the process, however with hard work and determination, a goal will always be reached.<br>  <p5/>
     <p6><br>If this project reaches success, the outcome will be stretched across the globe providing help and assistance to all hospitals in order to aid their patients with not just a simple application, but also a friend. We will not have any lost people that are too afraid or shy to ask for help but people who will be able to go on with their day to day lives. This will solve the problem of not one or two but millions. A big impact will be placed on all health organizations worldwide as less people worried will result in more people smiling.  <br>  <p6/>
